## Project: enterprise-app/
## Organization: Uvexzon

1. Git Workflow Strategy: GitFlow
## Branch Structure
| Branch      | Purpose                 | Rules                                                 |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Production-ready code   | Protected, no direct push, PR required                |
| `develop`   | Integration branch      | Developers merge feature branches after PR review     |
| `feature/*` | New features            | Created from `develop`, merged back into `develop`    |
| `bugfix/*`  | Bug fixes               | Created from `develop`, merged back into `develop`    |
| `hotfix/*`  | Urgent production fixes | Created from `main`, merged into `main` and `develop` |

## Why GitFlow?

Pros: 

Clear separation of production, development, and feature work

Supports parallel development of multiple features

Easy to manage releases and hotfixes

Cons:

Can be heavy for small teams or fast-paced releases

Merge complexity increases with long-lived branches

Comparison vs Trunk-Based Development
